# proximacapital-{REPO_NAME}

This is meant to template a basic proxima capital typescript package. In
particular, this repo demonstrates how to use `@proximacapital/infrastructure`
as a dependency, and leverages `@proximacapita/eslint-config` as a standardized
eslint config.

This repo also assumes that you're using `nvm` as your node version manager, and
thereby utilizes the `.nvmrc` to keep the `package.json#engines` and node
version in sync.
