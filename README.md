# proximacapital-{REPO_NAME}

This is meant to template a basic proxima capital typescript package. In particular, this repo demonstrates how to use `@proximacapital/infrastructure` as a dependency, and a source for your ES Lint configuration. See the repo `package.json` as an example.

This repo also assumes that you're using `nvm` as your node version manager, and thereby utilizes the `.nvmrc` to keep the `package.json#engines` and node version in sync.
